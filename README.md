# About 
Vers is a location based video sharing app where users can have the best video in their city, state country, and ranked globally. The app will allow users to upload up to a minute of video captured from the in-app camera (not camera roll). The app will then get the geo location of where the video was taken and compare the engagement of the video to other videos also taken in that area.
